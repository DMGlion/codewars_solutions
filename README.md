<H5>Count the smiley faces</H5>

Description:
<p>Given an array (arr) as an argument complete the function countSmileys that should return the total number of smiling faces.</p>
Rules for a smiling face:
-Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as : or ;
-A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are - or ~
-Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either ) or D.
No additional characters are allowed except for those mentioned.
Valid smiley face examples:
:) :D ;-D :~)
Invalid smiley faces:
;( :> :} :]

Example cases:

countSmileys([':)', ';(', ';}', ':-D']);       // should return 2;
countSmileys([';D', ':-(', ':-)', ';~)']);     // should return 3;
countSmileys([';]', ':[', ';*', ':$', ';-D']); // should return 1;



			Rotate for a Max

Let us begin with an example:

Take a number: 56789. Rotate left, you get 67895.

Keep the first digit in place and rotate left the other digits: 68957.

Keep the first two digits in place and rotate the other ones: 68579.

Keep the first three digits and rotate left the rest: 68597. Now it is over since keeping the first four it remains only one digit which rotated is itself.

You have the following sequence of numbers:

56789 -> 67895 -> 68957 -> 68579 -> 68597

and you must return the greatest: 68957.

Task
Write function max_rot(n) which given a positive integer n returns the maximum number you got doing rotations similar to the above example.

So max_rot (or maxRot or ... depending on the language) is such as:

max_rot(56789) should return 68957

max_rot(38458215) should return 85821534
