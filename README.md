<H4><strong>Count the smiley faces</strong></H4>

Description:
<p>Given an array (arr) as an argument complete the function countSmileys that should return the total number of smiling faces.</p>
Rules for a smiling face:
-Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as : or ;
-A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are - or ~
-Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either ) or D.
No additional characters are allowed except for those mentioned.
Valid smiley face examples:
:) :D ;-D :~)
Invalid smiley faces:
;( :> :} :]

Example cases:

countSmileys([':)', ';(', ';}', ':-D']);       // should return 2;
countSmileys([';D', ':-(', ':-)', ';~)']);     // should return 3;
countSmileys([';]', ':[', ';*', ':$', ';-D']); // should return 1;



<H4><strong>Rotate for a Max</strong></H4>

Let us begin with an example:

Take a number: 56789. Rotate left, you get 67895.

Keep the first digit in place and rotate left the other digits: 68957.

Keep the first two digits in place and rotate the other ones: 68579.

Keep the first three digits and rotate left the rest: 68597. Now it is over since keeping the first four it remains only one digit which rotated is itself.

You have the following sequence of numbers:

56789 -> 67895 -> 68957 -> 68579 -> 68597

and you must return the greatest: 68957.

Task
Write function max_rot(n) which given a positive integer n returns the maximum number you got doing rotations similar to the above example.

So max_rot (or maxRot or ... depending on the language) is such as:

max_rot(56789) should return 68957

max_rot(38458215) should return 85821534

<H4> Bouncing Balls </H4>

A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.

He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.

How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?

Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:
Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
Float parameter "window" must be less than h.
If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.

Note:
The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater than the window parameter.

Example:
- h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3

- h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1 

(Condition 2) not fulfilled).
