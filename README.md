<H4><strong>Count the smiley faces</strong></H4>

Description:
<p>Given an array (arr) as an argument complete the function countSmileys that should return the total number of smiling faces.</p>
Rules for a smiling face:
-Each smiley face must contain a valid pair of eyes. Eyes can be marked as : or ;
-A smiley face can have a nose but it does not have to. Valid characters for a nose are - or ~
-Every smiling face must have a smiling mouth that should be marked with either ) or D.
No additional characters are allowed except for those mentioned.
Valid smiley face examples:
:) :D ;-D :~)
Invalid smiley faces:
;( :> :} :]

Example cases:

countSmileys([':)', ';(', ';}', ':-D']);       // should return 2;
countSmileys([';D', ':-(', ':-)', ';~)']);     // should return 3;
countSmileys([';]', ':[', ';*', ':$', ';-D']); // should return 1;



<H4><strong>Rotate for a Max</strong></H4>

Let us begin with an example:

Take a number: 56789. Rotate left, you get 67895.

Keep the first digit in place and rotate left the other digits: 68957.

Keep the first two digits in place and rotate the other ones: 68579.

Keep the first three digits and rotate left the rest: 68597. Now it is over since keeping the first four it remains only one digit which rotated is itself.

You have the following sequence of numbers:

56789 -> 67895 -> 68957 -> 68579 -> 68597

and you must return the greatest: 68957.

Task
Write function max_rot(n) which given a positive integer n returns the maximum number you got doing rotations similar to the above example.

So max_rot (or maxRot or ... depending on the language) is such as:

max_rot(56789) should return 68957

max_rot(38458215) should return 85821534

<H4> Bouncing Balls </H4>

A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.

He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.

How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?

Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:
Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
Float parameter "window" must be less than h.
If all three conditions above are fulfilled, return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.

Note:
The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball is strictly greater than the window parameter.

Example:
- h = 3, bounce = 0.66, window = 1.5, result is 3

- h = 3, bounce = 1, window = 1.5, result is -1 

(Condition 2) not fulfilled).

<H4><strong>Common Denominators</strong></H4>


You will have a list of rationals in the form

 { {numer_1, denom_1} , ... {numer_n, denom_n} } 
or

 [ [numer_1, denom_1] , ... [numer_n, denom_n] ] 
or

 [ (numer_1, denom_1) , ... (numer_n, denom_n) ] 
where all numbers are positive ints.

You have to produce a result in the form

 (N_1, D) ... (N_n, D) 
or

 [ [N_1, D] ... [N_n, D] ] 
or

 [ (N_1', D) , ... (N_n, D) ] 
or

{{N_1, D} ... {N_n, D}} 
or

"(N_1, D) ... (N_n, D)"
depending on the language (See Example tests)

in which D is as small as possible and

 N_1/D == numer_1/denom_1 ... N_n/D == numer_n,/denom_n.
Example:

convertFracs [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)] `shouldBe` [(6, 12), (4, 12), (3, 12)]
Note:
Due to the fact that first translations were written long ago - more than 4 years - these translations have only irreducible fractions. Newer translations have some reducible fractions. To be on the safe side it is better to do a bit more work by simplifying fractions even if they don't have to be.

Note for Bash:
input is a string, e.g "2,4,2,6,2,8"

output is then "6 12 4 12 3 12"


<H4><strong>Multi-tap Keypad Text Entry on an Old Mobile Phone</strong></H4>

Prior to having fancy iPhones, teenagers would wear out their thumbs sending SMS messages on candybar-shaped feature phones with 3x4 numeric keypads.

------- ------- -------
|     | | ABC | | DEF |
|  1  | |  2  | |  3  |
------- ------- -------
------- ------- -------
| GHI | | JKL | | MNO |
|  4  | |  5  | |  6  |
------- ------- -------

|PQRS | | TUV | | WXYZ|
|  7  | |  8  | |  9  |
------- ------- -------
------- ------- -------
|     | |space| |     |
|  *  | |  0  | |  #  |
------- ------- -------
Prior to the development of T9 (predictive text entry) systems, the method to type words was called "multi-tap" and involved pressing a button repeatedly to cycle through the possible values.

For example, to type a letter "R" you would press the 7 key three times (as the screen display for the current character cycles through P->Q->R->S->7). A character is "locked in" once the user presses a different key or pauses for a short period of time (thus, no extra button presses are required beyond what is needed for each letter individually). The zero key handles spaces, with one press of the key producing a space and two presses producing a zero.

In order to send the message "WHERE DO U WANT 2 MEET L8R" a teen would have to actually do 47 button presses. No wonder they abbreviated.

For this assignment, write a module that can calculate the amount of button presses required for any phrase. Punctuation can be ignored for this exercise. Likewise, you can assume the phone doesn't distinguish between upper/lowercase characters (but you should allow your module to accept input in either for convenience).

Hint: While it wouldn't take too long to hard code the amount of keypresses for all 26 letters by hand, try to avoid doing so! (Imagine you work at a phone manufacturer who might be testing out different keyboard layouts, and you want to be able to test new ones rapidly.)

<H4><strong>Weight for weight
</strong></H4>

My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.

I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list". It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.

For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99. Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by "weights" of these numbers?

Example:
"56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes: "100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"

When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings and not numbers: 100 is before 180 because its "weight" (1) is less than the one of 180 (9) and 180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9), it comes before as a string.

All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.

Notes
it may happen that the input string have leading, trailing whitespaces and more than a unique whitespace between two consecutive numbers
Don't modify the input
For C: The result is freed.


<H4><strong>Find the missing letter</strong></H4>

Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter in the array.

You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. The length of the array will always be at least 2.
The array will always contain letters in only one case.

Example:

['a','b','c','d','f'] -> 'e'
['O','Q','R','S'] -> 'P'
(Use the English alphabet with 26 letters!)

<H4><strong>Decode the Morse code</strong></H4>

In this kata you have to write a simple Morse code decoder. While the Morse code is now mostly superceded by voice and digital data communication channels, it still has its use in some applications around the world.
The Morse code encodes every character as a sequence of "dots" and "dashes". For example, the letter A is coded as ·−, letter Q is coded as −−·−, and digit 1 is coded as ·−−−−. The Morse code is case-insensitive, traditionally capital letters are used. When the message is written in Morse code, a single space is used to separate the character codes and 3 spaces are used to separate words. For example, the message HEY JUDE in Morse code is ···· · −·−−   ·−−− ··− −·· ·.

NOTE: Extra spaces before or after the code have no meaning and should be ignored.

In addition to letters, digits and some punctuation, there are some special service codes, the most notorious of those is the international distress signal SOS (that was first issued by Titanic), that is coded as ···−−−···. These special codes are treated as single special characters, and usually are transmitted as separate words.

Your task is to implement a function that would take the morse code as input and return a decoded human-readable string.

For example:

MorseCodeDecoder.decode(".... . -.--   .--- ..- -.. .")
//should return "HEY JUDE"
NOTE: For coding purposes you have to use ASCII characters . and -, not Unicode characters.

The Morse code table is preloaded for you as a dictionary, feel free to use it:

Coffeescript/C++/Go/JavaScript/PHP/Python/Ruby/TypeScript: MORSE_CODE['.--']
C#: MorseCode.Get(".--") (returns string)
Elixir: @morse_codes variable (from use MorseCode.Constants). Ignore the unused variable warning for morse_codes because it's no longer used and kept only for old solutions.
Elm: MorseCodes.get : Dict String String
Haskell: morseCodes ! ".--" (Codes are in a Map String String)
Java: MorseCode.get(".--")
Kotlin: MorseCode[".--"] ?: "" or MorseCode.getOrDefault(".--", "")
Rust: self.morse_code
Scala: morseCodes(".--")
C: provides parallel arrays, i.e. morse[2] == "-.-" for ascii[2] == "C"
All the test strings would contain valid Morse code, so you may skip checking for errors and exceptions. In C#, tests will fail if the solution code throws an exception, please keep that in mind. This is mostly because otherwise the engine would simply ignore the tests, resulting in a "valid" solution.

Good luck!
